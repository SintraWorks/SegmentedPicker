# SegmentedPicker

SegmentedPicker is a custom segmented control implemented in SwiftUI. It supports automatic switching between a compact and a regular view depending on whether the regular view will fit the space available to the control. It therefore reacts dynamically to device rotation and to changes in dynamic font size.
